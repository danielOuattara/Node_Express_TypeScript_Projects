This frontend is for testing only. 

It is taken as like, from John Smilga github repo.

Yet there are error: 
 - when create a new job, there is a jobs fetch error after successful job has been created
 - when trying to edit a job, an unknown error is reported on the client

Also this frontend uses react v17 + old version of react router dom + useContext in combo with useReducer



Right now  don't have time to correct errors or to convert the whole frontend to Typescript + latest and secured package

May in some near future
